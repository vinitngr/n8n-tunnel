cloudflared tunnel run --protocol quic n8n-tunnel : default -- getting error in wsl , so using http2
cloudflared tunnel run --protocol http2 n8n-tunnel


- fixed the issue of tunnel not connecting with quic connection 
  - may be adding rule and later removing them helped , - rule in firewall to let all udp outgoing connection of 7xxx and 443 port , which rule i later deleted still worked
  - or may be i allowed and then block again the host process from glasswire
  - or may be i closed the warp connection , cloudflare warp
